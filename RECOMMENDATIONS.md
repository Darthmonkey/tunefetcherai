## 1. Dependencies and Project Structure

### A. Improvements & Cleanup

*   **Remove `ytdl-core` dependency**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 5% (Very Low - if truly unused, but worth verifying no hidden references)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Build process, server startup, any existing download functionality.
    *   **Reason:** This library is no longer used in `server.js` (replaced by `youtube-dl-exec` and `ffmpeg-static`). Removing it reduces bundle size and potential security vulnerabilities from unused packages.

*   **Uninstall `play-dl`**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 5% (Very Low - if truly unused, but worth verifying no hidden references)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Build process, server startup, any existing search or download functionality (if it was intended for future use).
    *   **Reason:** This library was installed but is not currently utilized in `server.js`. If there are no immediate plans to integrate it, uninstalling it cleans up dependencies.

*   **Replace `rimraf` with Node.js native `fs.rmSync`**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 15% (Low - `fs` operations can be sensitive, but `fs.rmSync` is robust)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** All download cleanup processes (single and multiple track downloads), ensuring temporary files are correctly removed.
    *   **Reason:** `fs.rmSync` (with `recursive: true` and `force: true`) is a more modern and often preferred alternative for recursive directory deletion.

*   **Downgrade `express` to a stable version (e.g., `^4.x.x`)**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 30% (Medium - dependency changes can have ripple effects across the backend)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Entire backend server functionality, all API endpoints (search, MusicBrainz, download), error handling.
    *   **Reason:** The current `express` version (`^5.1.0`) is a beta release. For production, it's generally safer to use a stable version unless specific beta features are required and thoroughly tested.

## 2. Backend Logic (`server.js`)

### A. Security & Hardening (Higher Priority for Internet Exposure)

*   **Implement Centralized Error Handling Middleware**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 25% (Medium - modifies core request/response flow)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** All API responses, especially error cases (e.g., invalid input, server errors, external API failures). Ensure no sensitive information is leaked.
    *   **Reason:** Ensures consistent, user-friendly error responses and prevents sensitive information (like internal file paths or stack traces) from being leaked.

*   **Implement Robust Server-Side Input Validation for All API Endpoints**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 35% (Medium - new validation rules can inadvertently block valid requests)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** All API endpoints that accept user input (search queries, artist/album names, YouTube URLs). Test with valid, invalid, and malicious inputs.
    *   **Reason:** Crucial for security. Client-side validation can be bypassed. Libraries like `zod` (already a dependency) or `express-validator` can be used.

*   **Configure HTTPS Enforcement**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 60% (High - requires environment setup, not just code changes)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Server accessibility, network configuration, client-server communication. This is primarily an infrastructure change.
    *   **Reason:** All traffic *must* be served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit for any internet-facing application.

*   **Move Sensitive Data to Environment Variables**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 20% (Medium - incorrect variable access can cause server startup issues or runtime errors)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Server startup, any part of the code that previously used hardcoded sensitive values (if any are identified beyond the User-Agent).
    *   **Reason:** Ensures sensitive information (e.g., potential future API keys) is not hardcoded.

### B. Efficiency & Robustness

*   **Replace Manual YouTube Search API Parsing (`/api/search`)**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 40% (High - major change to core search logic)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** YouTube search functionality, track URL finding, overall user experience when searching for tracks.
    *   **Reason:** The current implementation is fragile and prone to breaking with YouTube UI changes. A dedicated library or API client would be more robust.

*   **Convert Callback-Based `https.get` Calls to `async/await`**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 25% (Medium - refactoring asynchronous code can introduce subtle bugs)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** MusicBrainz API calls, YouTube search (if not replaced by a library), overall server responsiveness.
    *   **Reason:** Improves code readability and maintainability for asynchronous flows.

*   **Implement MusicBrainz API Rate Limiting/Retry Mechanisms**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 10% (Low - adds delays, not core logic change)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** MusicBrainz API call frequency, handling of MusicBrainz API errors.
    *   **Reason:** Ensures respect for MusicBrainz API limits and improves resilience to temporary API issues.

*   **Improve Temporary File Cleanup Reliability**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 10% (Low - improves existing cleanup)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Temporary file management after downloads (successful and failed), disk space usage.
    *   **Reason:** Ensures temporary files are *always* cleaned up, even after server crashes or interruptions.

*   **Integrate a Dedicated Logging Library (e.g., Winston, Pino)**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 5% (Low - adds logging, not core logic change)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Server console output, log file generation and content.
    *   **Reason:** Provides more structured, configurable, and manageable logging for production environments.

*   **Add `youtubeDl` Options (`noWarnings`, `noProgress`)**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 5% (Low - minor configuration change)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Server console output during download processes.
    *   **Reason:** Suppresses unnecessary console output for cleaner server logs.

## 3. Frontend Structure and Logic (`src` directory)

### A. Improvements & Best Practices

*   **Adopt Centralized State Management (e.g., Zustand, React Context API)**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 50% (High - major architectural change)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** All components managing application state (tracks, albums, loading indicators, user input), data flow throughout the application.
    *   **Reason:** Improves predictability, debugging, and scalability for growing state complexity.

*   **Refactor UI Components for Enhanced Reusability**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 20% (Medium - refactoring can introduce regressions in UI rendering)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** UI rendering, component props, overall visual consistency.
    *   **Reason:** Ensures UI components are generic and reusable, adhering to a clear separation of concerns.

*   **Improve Critical Error Display (Beyond Toasts)**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 10% (Low - primarily a UI change)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** How critical errors (e.g., network failures, unrecoverable API errors) are presented to the user.
    *   **Reason:** Provides more prominent or persistent error displays for issues requiring immediate user attention.

*   **Conduct Accessibility (A11y) Review and Implement Fixes**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 10% (Low - primarily UI/markup changes)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast, overall user interaction for users with disabilities.
    *   **Reason:** Ensures the application is usable by a wider audience.

*   **Implement Code Splitting/Lazy Loading for Routes/Large Components**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 30% (Medium - involves build configuration changes and routing adjustments)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Initial application load times, routing, component rendering.
    *   **Reason:** Improves initial load times by loading JavaScript only when needed.

*   **Continue Leveraging TypeScript for Strong Type Safety**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 0% (This is an ongoing development practice, not a single change)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Development process (compile-time errors), long-term code maintainability.
    *   **Reason:** Ensures data consistency and reduces runtime errors.

### B. Efficiency

*   **Optimize Static Images for Web Delivery**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 5% (Low - asset changes)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Image loading times, visual quality of images.
    *   **Reason:** Improves application load times and user experience.

*   **Monitor and Optimize JavaScript Bundle Size**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 5% (Low - optimization, not functional change)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Application load times.
    *   **Reason:** Reduces the amount of data transferred, improving performance.

### C. Obsolete/Unnecessary Components

*   **Remove Unused UI Components from `src/components/ui`**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 5% (Low - if truly unused)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Build size, ensuring no unexpected UI regressions if a component was subtly used.
    *   **Reason:** Reduces project clutter and bundle size.

*   **Remove `src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx` if Unused**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 5% (Low - if truly unused)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** Build size, any mobile-specific UI behavior.
    *   **Reason:** Cleans up unused code.

*   **Consolidate/Remove Redundant `use-toast.ts` hook**
    *   **Likelihood of Breaking:** 10% (Low - ensures consistent toast behavior)
    *   **Affected Areas for Testing:** All toast notifications throughout the application.
    *   **Reason:** There are two `use-toast.ts` files. Consolidating them reduces redundancy.
