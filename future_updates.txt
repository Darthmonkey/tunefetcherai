**Temporary Document: Future Updates for TuneFetcherAI**

**I. Automation Features:**

*   **One-Click Track Discovery and URL Generation:** Combine the "Find Track Information," "Generate AI Prompt," and "Find YouTube URLs" functionalities into a single button click. This would streamline the user experience and automate the process of discovering tracks and finding their corresponding YouTube URLs.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Create a new function that orchestrates the execution of the existing `generateTrackInfo`, `generatePrompt`, and `askAi` functions.
        *   Add a new button to the UI that triggers this combined function.
        *   Consider adding a loading state to the button to indicate that the process is running.
*   **"Download All" Button with Default Selection:** Add a "Download All" button that automatically selects all discovered tracks and initiates the download process.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Modify the `TrackTable` component to include a prop that allows for default selection of all tracks.
        *   Add a new button to the UI that triggers the `handleDownloadSelectedTracks` function with all tracks pre-selected.

**II. Testing and Refinement:**

*   **Thorough Testing of "Manual YouTube URLs" Button:** Conduct comprehensive testing of the "Manual YouTube URLs" button to ensure it functions correctly with various YouTube URLs and handles potential errors gracefully.
    *   **Testing Scenarios:**
        *   Valid YouTube URLs
        *   Invalid YouTube URLs
        *   URLs to playlists
        *   URLs to age-restricted content
        *   URLs to content with regional restrictions
    *   **Error Handling:**
        *   Implement robust error handling to catch potential issues during the download process and provide informative error messages to the user.

**III. Future Enhancements (Beyond the Scope of Immediate Updates):**

*   **Implement a progress bar for downloads:** To let the user know how far along the download is.
*   **Allow users to edit the file name:** Before downloading
*   **Allow users to choose the output folder:** For the downloaded file.
